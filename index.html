    <h1>Arrow99</h1>
    <p>A document, a side project, was initiated in May 2018.</p>
    <p>With a clear objective in mind.</p>
    <p>Currently, only I know what the objective and the document are about.</p>
    <p>I will be documenting my entire process here.</p>
    <p>To achieve one of my dreams, which is now one of my bigs goals.</p>
    <p>It is for me and by me, not meant to prove anything.</p>
    <p>For to inspire those who dare to try.</p>
    <p>However, it will take time. How long? We don't know.</p>
    <p>Just like everything worthwhile in this life.</p>
    <p>In May 2024, six years after its inception, you will witness its progress.</p>
    <p>See you, time is clicking...</p>
